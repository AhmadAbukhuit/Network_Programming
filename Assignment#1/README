Purpose: Get familiar with the blocks defining a network application

Description:
In this assignment, you are required to slightly modify and execute the client code given in Ch1
under UNIX/Linux environment.

Requirement:
For this assignment, you are required to work individually (Not in a group). The server is
running on a machine whose IP address is 10.242.xxx.yyy on port 10013. You need to supply the
IP address and a string representing your name in the command line. i.e
prompt> hw1 <ip_address> <name> where
hw1: the name of the executable code of hw1
ip_address: the server address
name: a string representing your name
The client program, once started, sends the name to the already running server. The server will
reply back with that same name together with the current time and date (the server is already
running for you). Finally, the client will print the result on the standard output and exits.
